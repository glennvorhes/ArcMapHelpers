This research demonstrates that there is potential value in rehabilitating vacant urban
parcels for use as truck parking facilities and that a CPA process based on GIS screening
provides an effective method to identify potential parking areas.
A minimum of 120, 2-acre parcels and 46, 5-acre parcels were identified for the cities of
Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and St. Louis, Missouri. A case study of one site from
each city found that the selected sites have potential value as truck parking facilities.
These findings are especially relevant for truck parking in urban areas due to the
increased need for parking close to the city center and industry, the congestion delays
impacting delivery schedules, and the increased concentration of trucks in industrial and
commercial zones.
A GIS-based parcel approach combined with partnership efforts including MPOs, DOTs
and city leaders can support safe truck parking and reduce the incidence of unsafe
parking practices.
This approach can be modified to suit the community. For example, a more focused
approach could be developed to avoid socially-sensitive areas or major highway bottlenecks.
Alternatively, the screening process could focus on parcels close to urban police
stations or well-traveled areas to increase the safety of the new facilities.
It should be noted that the problem of parking shortages extends beyond urban areas,
and urban parking solutions like the one described above must be seen as a complement
to, not a replacement for, the other policies of TPIMS, mobile applications, and opening
of facilities along existing rights of way. Full solutions to the United Statesâ€™ truck parking
shortage will require collaborative action between multiple levels of the government
and the private sector, and application of all of the policies described above. This CPA
action will not only help solve shortages but has the ability to lower costs of creating truck
parking by splitting costs across multiple agencies.
